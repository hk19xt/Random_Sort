# Random
This program is learning a Math.random function and sort 5 random numbers in order.

How to run this program:
1) This program accepts five random numbers by user.
2) The random numbers will be assigned from 1 to 1000.
3) The order is an ascending order. 
4) Therefore, if the followed number is smaller than the initial number, then the two numbers are swapped.

This program is using Dr.Java, and it is one of the individual assignments in school.
